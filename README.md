# SafeVote(An Anonymous Decentralized Voting system)
An anonymised, reliable and secure voting system that enables vote transparency and provides voters help in choosing the current candidate using Multi-party encryption.

## Problems faced by existing voting systems
* Delay between end of voting and results. 
* Lack of transparency, especially in electronic systems. How can one verify the vote count independently?
* Selling and buying of votes for short-term benefits. 
* Duplicate Votes. 
* Need for travelling to voting centers which causes less voter turnout. 
* Lack of correct knowledge of virtues and vices of every candidate.
 
## Technologies and features incorporated in the system
* Built on Ethereum blockchain for fine control of the participants of the voting "network".
* Multi-party encryption to enable vote transparency.
* Accompanied by information and statistics on candidates’ performance in the past elections.

## Our solutions to these problems
Each voter ID is randomly assigned a SHA256 token which is linked to his/her Aadhaar  ID. Voters will be required to login using their Aadhar ID and fingerprint (for biometric verification).The token generated on successful login can be used to vote and is registered on the blockchain.The vote is encrypted such that only the voter and the election authority's combined secret id can access it.
* Live counting of votes ensures that delay between voting and results is eliminated and ensures that every person/node on blockchain network can verify the vote tally in real time.
* Each voter ID issued is associated with a voter Token. Each voter token is a part of the blockchain. This guarantees no possibility of someone voting twice using the same credentials hence eliminating the possibility of duplicate vote.
* Since the voting process will be completely online, there is no need for people to have to travel to their polling booths to vote. 
* As provision of candidates’ information and account of their previous works is there ( a sort of report card ), voters can make an informed decision which candidate to choose.
* Since the token is linked to Aadhar,therefore any major is obliged to vote without the need of a voter ID.
